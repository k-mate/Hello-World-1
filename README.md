# Hello-World-1
another hello-world repository 
i created a repository called "hello-world"
but then i mistakenly pressed enter without pressing on the checkin button for README file
so i created a new repository adding 1 to the name
i wanted to delete the first repository, but could not do so as i am new to GitHub
